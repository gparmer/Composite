## CPU Burn Component

A simple component that burns CPU cycles, nothing else.
Can be used in test scenarios as background, CPU-intensive computations.

### Description

Simple infinite loop, nothing more.

### Usage and Assumptions

Only depends on the `init` interface, so it can be used anywhere from on top of the constructor, all the way to as a component under the scheduler.

/* 
 * The lifetime of tmem cbufs is determined by the cbuf_alloc and
 * cbuf_free of the calling component.  The called component uses
 * cbuf2buf to retrieve the buffer.  
 *
 * API for sender of transient memory cbufs:
 *     void *cbuf_alloc(int size, cbuf_t *id)
 *     void cbuf_free(void *)
 * API for the receiver of transient memory cbufs:
 *     void *cbuf2buf(cbuf_t cb, int len)
 * 
 * Persistent cbufs are reference counted, so their lifetime needs to
 * be explicitly managed by calls to access and free the buffer, both
 * in the sender and receiver.  In the sender, alloc references it,
 * send tracks the liveness, and deref releases the buffer.
 * send_deref both sends and dereferences it.  The receiver of the
 * persistent cbuf references the cbuf via cbuf2buf.  The receiver
 * must use send an d deref just as the sender if it is also going to
 * send the buffer.
 *
 * API for sender of persistent cbufs:
 *     void *cbufp_alloc(unsigned int sz, cbufp_t *cb)
 *     void cbufp_send(cbufp_t cb)
 *     void cbufp_deref(cbufp_t cbid) 
 *     void cbufp_send_deref(cbufp_t cb) // combine the previous ops
 * API for the receiver of persistent cbufs;
 *     void *cbufp2buf(cbufp_t cb, int len)
 *     void cbufp_deref(cbufp_t cbid) 
 * Note that receiver might take the role of the sender.

/* 
 * Naming scheme: The cbuf_* functions are transient memory
 * allocations -- their lifetime must match an invocation.  The

 * (but that don't come with a guarantee about bounded access, thus
 * predictable sharing of the buffer).
 */

/* 
 * Shared buffer management for Composite.
 *
 * A delicate dance between cbuf structures.  There are a number of
 * design goals: 1) cbuf_t must be passed between components without
 * shared memory (i.e. it must fit in a register).  2) each component
 * should be able to efficiently allocate memory for a given principal
 * (i.e. thd) that can be accessed by that principal in other
 * components (but not necessarily written).  3) Each component should
 * be able to efficiently and predictably find a buffer referenced by
 * a cbuf_t.  These are brought in to the component on-demand, i.e. if
 * a component has already accessed the page that holds the cbuf, then
 * it will be able to find it only from its own "cache"; however, if
 * it hasn't, it will need to bring in that buffer from another
 * component using shared memory.  Locality of access will ensure that
 * this is the uncommon case.  4) A component given a cbuf_t should
 * not have a chance of crashing when accessing the buffer.  This
 * implies that the cbuf_t does not contain any information that can't
 * be verified as correct from the component's own data-structures.
 *
 * A large assumption I'm making is that buffers can be fragmented and
 * spread around memory.  This relies on a programming model that is
 * scatter-gather.  This assumption enables all buffers to be less
 * than or equal to the size of a page.  Larger "buffers" are a
 * collection of multiple smaller buffers.
 *
 * Given these constraints, the solution we take follows:
 *
 * 1) cbuf_t is 32 bits, and includes a) the id associated with the
 * page containing the buffer.  This id is assigned by a trusted
 * component, and the namespace is shared between components (i.e. the
 * id is meaningful and is the identify mapping between components),
 * and b) the offset into the page for the desired object.  This
 * latter offset is not the byte-offset.  Instead each page is "typed"
 * in that it holds objects only of a certain size, and more
 * specifically, and array of objects of a specific size.  The offset,
 * is the index into this array.
 *
 * 2) cbuf_meta is a data-structure that is stored per-component, thus
 * it is trusted by the component to which it belongs.  A combination
 * of the (principal_id, cbuf page id) is used to lookup the
 * appropriate referenced cbuf_meta structure, and it also fits in 32
 * bits so that it can be held directly in the index structure (it's
 * lookup structure).  It holds a) a pointer to the page in this
 * component, and b) the size of objects held in this page.
 *
 * 3) Any references to buffers via interface invocations pass both
 * the cbuf_t, and the length of the allocation, if it is less than
 * the size associated with the page.  
 *
 * With these three pieces of data we satisfy the constraints because
 * 1) cbuf_t is 32 bits and is passed in a register between
 * components, 2) a component can allocate its own buffers, and share
 * their cid_t with others, 3) cbuf_meta can be found efficiently
 * using cbuf_t, and we get the buffer pointer from the cbuf_meta's
 * data, and the length of the buffer from the argument to the
 * interface function, 4) cbuf_meta information is trusted and not
 * corruptible by other components, and though it is found using
 * information in the untrusted cbuf_t, that data is verified in the
 * cbuf_meta lookup process (i.e. does the page id exist, does the it
 * belong to the principal, etc...).
 */

/***
 * Concurrency invariants:
 * 
 * 1) While the cbuf lock is taken, only this thread will access the
 * slab and set the USED bits in the meta structure.  Keep in mind
 * that many of the functions that call the cbuf manager interface
 * functions do drop this lock, thus requiring us to re-check the
 * state of these data-structures.
 *
 * 2) While the USED bit is set in a meta entry, the cbuf manager will
 * not remove the cbuf from us and from the meta-entry.  Therefore,
 * setting the USED bit acts as a form of a lock between this
 * component and the manager.
 */

/***
 * On data-structure consistency:
 *
 * The cbuf_meta data-structure is shared between manager and client,
 * and is one-to-one mapped with the cbufs themselves.  These are
 * indexed by the cbuf id.  The cbuf_alloc_descs are a client-local
 * data-structure tracking the cbuf allocations (and caching them).
 * These are indexed by the address of the cbuf (to enable cbuf_free),
 * and stored in local free-lists.
 *
 * When the USED bit is not set in the cbuf_meta structure (i.e. it is
 * in the common case on a free-list in the client), the manager can
 * remove it at any time.  This means that free-list entries can exist
 * that don't actually refer to a cbuf.  We call these stale free-list
 * entries (see __cbuf_alloc_meta_inconsistent for the check to see if
 * this is the case) that must be cleaned up.
 *
 * The more difficult case is this: 1) the manager removes a cbuf from
 * the client (but the free-list entry still remains), 2) a thread t_0
 * attempts to allocate a cbuf and must ask the manager for a new cbuf
 * which is then mapped into the client and added to the cbuf_meta
 * structure (with the USED bit set) at the same address of the old
 * cbuf that was removed, and 3) before it can return, another thread
 * t_1 enters the cbuf code and finds the stale free-list entry.  The
 * question here is this: How does t_1 know that the free-list entry is
 * stale, and that it should be deallocated?  Answer: If a cbuf is
 * marked as USED when it is seen to be on the free-list, we know this
 * case has been triggered.  
 *
 * Similar to this latter case, when a thread allocates a new cbuf
 * (cbuf_c_create), it should check to see if a freelist descriptor
 * exists before allocating a new one to avoid two descriptors
 * existing for one cbuf.
 *
 * Luckily, the correct way to fix all these inconsistencies is the
 * same: deallocate the allocation free-list descriptor.

    Add dockerfile to containerized build or dev platform
    
    tools/docker includes documentation and dockerfile for building
    a containerized buildsystem.  Support for sharing a directory
    between guest and host.  Documentation for differnt use casees.
    
    The docerfile currently contains a few packages which are not
    strictly necessary to build composite.  These include development
    tools like tmux, and compilation tools needed for arm platform
    which will be mainlined eventually.  Neither increases container
    size by large ammount.

    Swith vagrant provision script from super user to user
    
    By default vagrant provision scripts run as super user.  Rust
    build system does not need priv to be installed.  If it is
    installed as super user, it is installed in /root/.cargo and
    is inaccessable without sudo.
    
    Other commands within provision script were already using sudo

    A different (safer capability slot) workaround for kernel printing.
    
    * Though this is useless in most cases, VGA is still kernel level and
      to print to VGA, we still need to make a system call. That is used
      by me on "assert"s to be able to differentiate the normal logs in a
      multi-processor environment where logs are very garbled due to heavy
      parallelism..
      Asserts are a very important debugging tool and if they're lost in
      that garbled output, hard to debug therefore I took a easy route to
      print through kernel when there is an assert() trigger (which
      essentially means that the system is useless anyway!).

    scheduling module prio to start from TCAP_PRIO_MAX
    
    * When I set a thread (aep)'s priority to 0 and called cos_tcap_transfer,
      it was not 0, it was instead the priority of the current tcap.
      This led to my current with prio == 1 to not be preempted because of some
      other wierdness in a testcase I had. But the idea here is that,
      cos_tcap_transfer/delegate use TCAP_PRIO_MAX as the highest priority and
      if we pass 0, it would not set to 0.
      I fixed that in sl_mod_fprr to use priority from 1 to N instead of 0 to N-1.
      Added other consistency checks in the code.
    * Also changed to use consistent code to not have a variable to hold cpuid.
      This is just cosmetic.
    * another change, sl_init() to use the sched information from the static
      cos_defcompinfo_curr_get instead of hardcoding to INITXXX offsets.
      (Not tested for non INITXXX but!)

    Fixed ipi handling (rcving core) to activate threads based on tcap_higher_prio
    
    * Currently, we only receive IPIs and return to the currently running thread,
      that is incomplete. Fixed that to activate the "highest" priority (tcap quality)
      thread from the IPIs processed.
    * Fixed some naming to match existing use. :)
    * Made some variables in lapic to be volatile, just a safety measure!

    Bugfixes in sinv_async library and unit-test infrastructure
    
    * Made 3 parts of sinv_async.h library: sinv_client, sinv_server and acom_client.
      For cross-core, we'd use sinv_client by the client component and sinv_server by the
      server component.
      For same core, cross-component we'd use acom_client (not tested yet) and sinv_server
      in the interposition component.
    
    * The applications (non-schedulers) also call `schedinit_chlid` to initialize their
      init thread to be able to make use this invocation ability!
      Scheduler components also, the initthd will only be able to use "functional" interface
      after `schedinit_child`.
    
    * Fixed some of the untested paths in capmgr and obviously fully untested sinv_async library.
    
    * Created a srv_dummy interface and the implementation directory that also houses the
      scheduling interfaces. An implementation "cdummy" is on the client side which converts the
      interface to ASYNC communication. Another "sdummy" implementation which is the actual implementation
      of the srv_dummy.h interface.
      Created another srvdummy_stubcomp in no_interface which implements the server side of sinv_async
      library.
      Created a unit_srvdummy component that makes invocations to srv_dummy interface. Creates 2 additional
      threads which also make the invocations. TESTED: all invocations are interposed by "cdummy" and
      srvdummy_stubcomp and return path is synchronized.

    Library for converting SINV calls to ASYNC requests (for cross-core)
    
    * Idea: The applications (make sinv to a component that's only
      running on the other core) continue making the same calls. However,
      we'd introduce a "SCHEDULER" component on the same core as applications
      which will implement the INTERFACE of a required component and the
      implementation converts sync calls to async request cross-core and
      POLL for response.
      On the server core, we'd have a component (non-scheduler) with it's
      INITTHD waiting in main_loop for creating threads, one per requesting
      client thread. In this creation path, we'd setup the uni-/bi-directional
      communication channels and set them up for making SINV cross-core.
    
    * Client side:
      call to client_init() with the key that it uses to write requests on
      shared-memory that the main_loop() on server side waits/polls on..
    
      Every request includes keys for creating threads and hooking in the
      communication channels (bi/uni directional).
    
    * TODO: need a capmgr API to create a "RCVCAP" for a thread that passes
      key.. The idea is, this is an interposition layer, so don't want to
      interpose in a lot of places for each thread creation....
      Instead an explicit API to create RCVCAP would be better and that will
      be used by this library on interposition..
    
      However, on creation of each thread, client_thread_init() should be called
      so that it creates a server thread on the server core..
    
    * I initially named this "SINV_XCORE".. but there is absolutely nothing that
      I do here is saying it's "CROSS CORE". So renamed it back to "SINV_ASNYC".
      Though the purpose of this is just SINV_XCORE but nothing is preventing it
      from being used to convert a SINV call to ASYNC call of some sort..

    capmgr,sched, sl AEP allocation API with ipi window and ipi maximum
    
    * Modified the capmgr, sched and sl interfaces to allow passing ipi window
      and ipi maximum information.
    * Modified to not use default values for these, instead treat it as no rate
     limits for not passing it.. This was the result of a discussion with Gabe.
     Idea is, going forward we'd pass this info in linker scripts.. So we might
      just get rid of this API changes..
     But for now, if someone says they don't need rate-limiting, we'd really
     have impact on the system, which is still bad.. So need to be careful with
     this!

    Add ability to create cross-core "SINV" for rate-limiting
    
    * IPI Rate limiting information will be passed by the "RCV" or AEP thread
      creator. This information is used to rate-limit the number of incoming
      cross-core "asnds" to the AEP thread.
    * `capmgr_asnd_xxx_create()` API will return a "sinv" cap if the ASND
      is for a rcvcap that is on another core. And will return a "asnd" cap
      if that is on the same core.
      TODO: if rcvcap doesn't have "rate" information, either use some default
      rate information or return a "asnd" instead of "sinv".
    * Using default rate-limiting factors help in controlling number of IPIs
      on ANY "rcv" capability. Therefore, I'll make it to use that ability in
      the next commit.

    channel interface to create a shared data channel for communication
    
    * This interface allows us to create a channel based on a static namespace
      using the cos_channelkey_t.. If two components want to communicate with
      each other but not worry about their ancestry or hierarchy, this API along
      with AEP creation API and shared keys enables two arbitrary components to
      talk to each other! We need access control for which components can talk to
      which others! Perhaps based on the dependencies in runscripts?? (This is not
      currently done however!).
    * I've also modified to return the mapped information if we make a duplicate
      map call either in memmgr or channel interface!
    * I was slightly confused between channel vs shmchannel. But I chose
      channel because it's shorter and perhaps allows us to also for ex,
      combine shared memory creation and asnd creation API using a channel key!

    Added ck submodule and support for sl cross-core thread creation
    
    * sl_xcpu_xxxx() api for cross-core requests! Currently only a single
      API sl_xcpu_thd_alloc() is supported and tested!
    * `sl_global_init()` is called from inside `sl_init()` on the first
      call to it, so global init is not exposed!
      TODO: pass the cpu bitmap in `sl_init` for information about which
      cpu/cores does this scheduler run on! Right now, it's hard coded within
      sl_init!
    * Added ability to create `asndcap` from one core to all other cores for
      cross-core notifications!

    Fixed woken race in voter test and also for AEP threads
    
    * added a long description in sl_thd.h for what the idea is for
      the fix for AEP threads.. Essentially, if a thread is not blocked on
      cos_rcv, a kernel "unblocked" event should not bother what the thread
      state is at the user-level and the user-level block/yield should reset
      kernel state in the scheduler data structure as the thread is running
      or has been running without the scheduler's knowledge!
      Therefore kernel event isn't really a thread state, designed it that way!

    Lock to make vas frontier updates atomic and bump expands for it atomic
    
    * There is a race bug that leads to asserts trigger in page_bump_alloc
      from a system call. In my understanding PTEs are allocated by one core
      and used by other core which does also valloc.. I'm going to debug this
      further to get to the core of the problem.. But this fix makes things
      flawless on multi-core (tested with 8 cores).

    Updated to use ps_lock instead of my own.
    
    * Talked to Yuxin about using locks here.
      Issues,
      1. We could be propagating errors to user-level and not use locks.
         I think these are not performance intensive paths and the idea here
      is only to maintain consistency of the shared frontiers (across cores) and
      not to solve for example system call errors, which we'd still need to either
      propagate to the user or BUG()/assert() as we've now.
      2. Reason for locks, vs retry logic for data structure consistencies:
         Having locks ensure that we don't update frontiers when we don't need to
      so we don't have holes created in the capability slots. Plus, again, if we
      need to propagate retries, we can do that with `try_lock` instead of with
      the internal API failures. Which would ensure we maintain simple code and
      less complex retry logic around it.
      3. Whether locks are a long-term solution:
         I'd think the locks are mainly here for maintaining the cos_kernel_api
      library data-structure consistency and that around the APIs that are not
      performance sensitive or for which we don't upper-bound (??).
      So unless we want to have a totally lock free user-level(user of the lib)
      retry version, this doesn't feel like a short-term solution to me!
      4. We could be work to make the lock usage more efficient: Perhaps we can.
         Ex: In bump_alloc_generic, we don't need locks to be used for per-core bump
      allocs. I have not thought this through but I don't think it matters as much
      but there could be room for optimizing the usage!
    
    * TODO: The only issue I think after this is with `cos_page_bump_alloc()`
      and I need to fix it. In my opinion I think it is probably not related
      to frontiers (very well could be) but is mostly related to atomicity of
      bump_expand and that PTE may need additional extension.. This is still
      not a complete thought, will debug deeper..
      The reason I say this is because `page_bump_alloc()` in most of my tests
      don't crash except for micro_booter which tests it more rigorously in that
      the page_bump_allocs() cause additional PTEs to be allocated and if executions
      interleave, they should be causing issues!

    * defcompinfo is initialized in the posix lib including meminfo_init and sl_init.
      The unit cxx re inits meminfo, which was earlier used by sl_init to create an `idle` thread
      up on `sl_init`. So, mmap in posix was bombing out! Fixed it!
    
    * We need a checklist for what should be tested for a PR.
      More so, Gabe has been stressing this point a lot, we need a cleaner UNIT TEST SUITE.

      checklist, they know what's FAILING/PASSING and make notes in their PR to begin with!

    * This allows booter/capmgr to run 1 to N-1 CPUs to run initialization
      in parallel. (no more serializing required).
    * There are still some random crashes (noticed one in microbooter for heap alloc),
      I'll continue to debug those.
      But this is much stable version than before!
    * Tested my unit test for hierarchical scheduling with ~9 components, capmgr test,

    * However, when the scheduler receives events from the kernel, they're
      for AEPs and must not have races. More importantly, kernel events could
      be redundant blocked/unblocked events.
    * NOTE: There could be some complex interleaving with AEP threads that
      I may be missing, could still have some issues. Will need to debug those
      as they occur.

    AEP creation (initaep or other) using global keys with capmgr
    
    * cos_aepkey_t is used for passing keys to create an AEP thread.
      Send creation also takes key to create a send-ep to that AEP with
      matching key.
    * If key == 0, then it is considered private key. So in most cases
      we'd create initaeps with key == 0 and also for AEPs that are
      associated only to interrupts, should really use key == 0.
      These keys are meant for cross-component communication where the
      sender and receiver are identified with a shared key!

    Added lazy child thread lookup using capmgr_thd_retrieve
    
    * Ideally, all child threads MUST be initialized in the parent using
      schedinit_child() before child component threads could make invocations.
      But if this is not adhered to for any reasons, then a child thread
      could make invocation and the parent may not find it's data structure
      for that thread. In such a case, we do lazy thread retrieval from the
      capmgr and initialize our sl_thd data-structure. The complication is,
      it is done without entering critical section. This is a very important
      detail to note.
    * If a current thread is both a child component thread and it's dependent
      thread is also child component thread, the critical section issue is
      still applicable to the current thread lookup, which once is done, will
      enter a cs, so not applicable to looking up a dependency child (unless the
      lookup is done without taking a cs.)

    Bugfix: resolving forward dependencies
    
    * If a component comes before a component that it has interface dependencies
      on, then the loading fails because the interface impl component is still
      not created. To fix this, resolve UNDEF symbols only after all components
      are created.

    Using linker facility to get hierarchy information in llbooter
    
    * no more "sl_" or "<a>_<b>_"!!
      A scheduler component is denoted using "*" before component name in the
      runscript.
      But the only important thing is, root scheduler
      must be named "boot.o" and the resource manager must be "mm.o".
      Plus for the linker facility to work correctly, it must follow this order in
      the runscript: llboot.o-<dummy.o>-mm.o-<dummy2.o>-boot.o-<remaining comps>

    Modified interface and implementation to use global identifiers in shared memory
    
    * Bit-packing would still require the same level of modifications especially if
     I want to use unique(1:1 associative) global identifiers to access the regions.
     In bitpacking case, I'd use "origin" spdid (the creator of shm region) and the offset
     packed together. But for mapping in and being able to point to the region in
     the destination space, would need to use same array "indexes" for simplicity.
     Implementation would end up being very much the same.
     Now, this is similar to what Robbie has. Uses global array index for identifying
     shared memory in any component.
    
    * Also added unit test for mapping in shared memory and it works!!
      Cool thing: works for alloc of npages.. map maps in npages correctly!

    Separating out sched operations from allocation management

    * resmgr: using resmgr interface. a component using this library will
      have synchronous invocations to resource manager for allocation of resources.

    Massive commit: Resmgr working! (tested for resmgr_thd_create)
    * added sinv op for resmgr to get initthd info from booter for booter == parent components
    * moved sl.c to sl_raw.c for use from llbooter or resmgr.
    * created a copy of sl_raw.c -> sl_resmgr.c (yet to replace api to use resmgr).
    * added sinv stub for multiple return vals.
    * added more api to cos_defkernel_api, cos_kernel_api and sl (might be able to cleanup some of
      unnecessary ones soon.)
    * added llparent.h so components can call down to parent components (set up by llbooter) for
      init protocol.

    Allow SL SCHED LOOP to be NON_BLOCKING
    
    * This is useful in hierarchical env, and in env where the booter
      is not the scheduler.
      For ex: Vkernel booter is just chronos and RK scheduler is the
      system scheduler. RK scheduler doesn't BLOCK on SCHED_RCV.
      But the child schedulers, for ex: the hpet timer subsystem
      scheduler blocks when it doesn't have anything to do.
    * TODO: Need a way to disable "IDLE THREAD", instead just let
      the scheduler loop run!

      list, fixing that!
    * Also change to use `ps_list_head_empty` for checking if list is
      empty is more readable than using `ps_list_is_head()`.

    Bugfixes - undo redundant events optimizations and more
    
    * budget expiry events are not really meaningful because thread state
      may change before scheduler receives any such notification.
      so taking that out.
    * for root INITRCV, on its call to cos_sched_rcv, it resumes but the
      register states for output parameters in cos_sched_rcv are not cleared.
      this causes issues.
    * finally, with redundant events from kernel, SL_THD_WOKEN is really
      not useful. One way to still retain it is to have that state for non-AEP
      threads, but don't think that's necessary for now.

    Bugfixes
    
    * sl: sl_thd_block was broken because it was trying to set a timeout for
      a non-timeout block.
          sl_cs_exit_schedule_nospin_arg should be able to schedule a thread
      that is in SL_THD_WOKEN state.
    * kernel: tcap_next should be set to current tcap for switching to scheduler.
    * cos_kernel_api: cos_switch bit packing fix: packing higher order 16bits from
      48bit prio into higher order 16bits of arg3 to call_cap_op.

      thread association is not 1:1, with scheduler tcap at least it is

    Adding back the /*TODO: */ comment in `sl_thd_free`
    
    * We cannot actually deallocate the thread while executing in it.
      Need a separate reaper thread that manages these backend deallocations.
      `sl_thd_free` will perhaps set the state to `SL_THD_DYING` and wakeup
      the reaper thread to clean it up.
      This TODO is for reaper thread functionality in sl.

    Critical-section in `sl_thd_alloc` and `sl_thd_free`.
    
    * cFE unit-tests have thread deallocation tests and found out that
      thread was being woken up from timeout-queue when it is being deleted.
      To avoid races, and to cleanup the thread (except the actual system resource)
      use critical-section and delete it from timeout queue and scheduling
      policy module.
    * It would be good if `sl_thd_alloc` is also atomic w.r.t sl library,
      so that there will not be races in backend allocations when users dynamically
      allocate more threads. Added that.
    * removed assert when there is nothing to schedule from `sl_mod_schedule`.
    * also added basic unit-tests for `sl_thd_free`. (idle thread runs after
      all test threads are deleted in the system.)

    Wakeup for threads through timeout module
    
    * timeout module has a min-heap that's sorted in ascending order of
      the required wakeup times. heap is checked every at every "schedule"
      call and expired threads are woken up.
    * at every `sl_thd_block()`, thread is added to wakeup heap and is woken-up
      at it's next period. (implicit).
    * nit: there is a symbol error for -`free` in `heap` library, perhaps
      `musl` doesn't have it? for now, not using `heap_alloc` or `heap_destroy`
      so `#define`d them to use only for LINUX tests.

      have hierarchical scheduling.

    Added cos_kernel_api functions for explicitly managing the internal `pgtblcap_t`'s of page-tables
    
    - Added API for extending the internal structures of pgtbls and getting their pgtblcaps
    - Added API for extending a pgtbl (consing it) using a given pgtblcap
    
    I don't have the infrastructure to test this yet, but it is backwards compatible for now.

    Implement sl_lock, a library for locking built on sl
    
    sl_lock provides a few basic primitives for locking. I think it
    might be useful for projects other than cFE2cos, for which it was
    initially developed.

    Fix hardcoded stack size and alignment

[33mcommit f59b208d9bd40bbe0fde3d0bdf3f38fb7f02482f[m
Author: Gregor Peach <gregorpeach@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Jun 26 15:43:45 2017 -0400

    Fix hardcoded stack size and alignment
    
    Thread stack size is supposed to be determined by a constant in
    consts.h. A lot of the code in the codebase relies on this,
    including the code for fetching the a thread's id. However, the
    assembly code that was really allocating the stack was using a
    hardcoded value.
    
    This mismatch led to invalid thread id's being returned, and
    broke increasing stack sizes to avoid stack overflows.
    
    To fix this, I made the assembly dependent on #defines, and made
    sure those defines were available for those files. I also fixed
    how those defines were structured in the first place.

    -EBUSY if scheduler has pending notifications and cannot switch threads
    
    * Kernel: If a scheduler thread has pending events, cos_switch instead of switching to
      an intended thread, switches back to the scheduler. Two problems: one, scheduler
      thread had no way to know that, so fixed with -EBUSY. two, instead of immediately
      returning back to scheduler, kernel was doing complete switch procedure to switch
      to the scheduler thread, which is also fixed with this error return.
    * Scheddev:
      * Entering scheduler critical-section needs special handing for scheduler thread
        with -EBUSY from cos_switch.
      * Fine-grained locking in sl_sched_loop.

    Change the src Makefile to use PLATFORM_ID instead of PLATFORM
    
    The src Makefile creates a temporary file that stores the name of
    the platform the build is running on. (It does this when you run
    `make config`.) This file was historically called PLATFORM, which
    worked fine. However, there is a folder in the src directory
    called `platform`. On case insensitive file systems this causes an
    obvious problem. To fix this, I modified the Makefile to use
    PLATFORM_ID instead.

    Added ACPI MADT parsing to find local APICs and I/O APICs
    
    Currently, we ignore all other types of interrupt descriptors but do see quite a few Interrupt Source Override Structures (5.2.12.5 in ACPI specification version 5.0).  Yet to test on a multiprocessor, but this is changing no state (only parsing) so is an inocuous change.

    Bugfixes in timer drivers
    
    * HPET: Configuration register programming isn't correct. It was
      working by coincidence and because it's mainly used for periodic,
      we were able to get away with it. (I'm still not sure why we couldn't
      catch this bug when HPET was used for oneshots.
    
    * LAPIC Timer: Divide Configuration Register values were not correct.
      But it doesn't affect very much because oneshot calibration is dynamic,
      and oneshot programming is with the use of that value.

    * Timeout must be an offset from `now` + (remaining time) after

    * `cos_defswitch` api takes `tcap_time_t` value. Added a new variable
      to schedlib globals that holds timeout value for corresponding `timer_next`
      cycles value and using that for the `cos_defswitch` api.

    Avoiding timer reprogramming
    
    * Timer reprogramming on every context switch could be expensive.
      This can be avoided by using global next_timer variable and
      with additional checks.
    
    * On x86, thread-switch with programming is double the cost of
      simple thread-switch. So it is worth avoiding it if we can.

    - Untested, but functionally complete.
    - sl_mod_fprr.c and sl_policy.h implement the pluggable scheduling policy
    - sl_consts.h and sl_timer_mod_periodic.c each represent customized implementations of specific scheduling and timer policies
    - unit_schedlib.c is the unit test framework
    - sl.{c|h} are the actual scheduling library

    lapic timer diff threshold, kernel api
    
    * timer diff threshold may vary between the timer type chosen.
      `ONESHOT` is less accurate than `TSC-DEADLINE`, so choice here should
      reflect in the `cycles_same` comparison both in `tcap` kernel-level
      and at user-level.
    * added an api for user to access the threshold. and modified `cycles_same`
      to consider this variance.

    * VMs have only 1 Tcap each, while DOM0 has a INITTCAP and 1 Tcap per I/O channel,

    Shared-memory between VMs and VKernel
    
    * This is a first step towards Inter-VM communication, mainly between
      DOM0 (vm0) and other VMs.
    * For now, the shared-memory is created for 4MB * VM_COUNT size and
      all of which is accessible in VKernel and DOM0, while, VMs can only
      access 4MB that are designated for DOM0<->VM data channel.
    * next step todo, I/O capabilities.

    Avoid retries in TSC_DEADLINE MSR Write
    
    * I misread the specification, there is no retry required in writes
      to TSC_DEADLINE MSR and especially because it seems it's not a
      serializing instruction, so retry could introduce unnecessary races.
    
    * Only writes to LVT REG and TSC_DEADLINE MSR need to be serialized
      which isn't required in our implementation as we do not register
      for Timers immediately after writing to LVT register. We only do it
      after returning to user-mode and upon TCaps changes.

    * Current state of the thread is not modified when there is a asnd
      event to it, thread state is only modified when a thread is switched

      whether the thread state is RCVING, so a scheduler can switch to it
      if it sees eligible. This may not be a permanent solution, see

    Tcap budget tracking, and active tcap maintenance and usage.
    
    At the highest level, this commit adds proper budget tracking for tcaps into the system, proper active tcap tracking
    
    The thread switching logic had to be completely re-architected to
    1. decouple tcap switching from thread switching, and
    2. enable most paths to do the normal switch of tcap + thread, but to
       allow the tcap budget manipulations to be followed with logic for
       finding a tcap if the current one is out of budget.
    
    This cleaned up the logic quite a bit and enhanced the separation of
    concerns between time management in tcaps, and normal thread state
    manipulations.
    
    Added the code for the tcap active list using list.h.  The tcap active
    list is only used in these four instances:
    
    1. When budget is transferred between tcaps.  This can both remove the
       gifting tcap, and add the recipient tcap.
    2. Tcap consume will remove a tcap from the list if all of its budget
       is consumed.
    3. When a one-shot timer occurs, if the current tcap, and its
       scheduler have no budget, then a tcap is removed from the active list.
    4. At initialization to add chronos.
    
    Cleans up the code for accessing rcv capability information (thread,
    tcap, scheduler).

    Initial commit with budget tracking and timer vectoring.
    
    Implements the use of one-shot timers for all time-keeping in the
    system.  This means that when switching between threads, we can set
    the next timeout, and if a value isn't provided, or if an asnd
    activates a thread, then we use the tcap budget to set the timer.
    
    This code *does not* fully support budget tracking and interrupt
    vectoring as will need to be implemented in the final system.
    
    It does:
    
    - micro_booter `test_timer` uses tcap budgets and thread switch timeouts
    - add a chal interface for setting the oneshot timer
    - add a time API for the micro-booter that enables the specification
      of timeouts on an absolute timeline, with conversions to and fro cycles
    - budget accounting/consumption on tcaps
    
    It does not:
    
    - budgets < INF (lack of testing)
    - do accurate accounting...it seems that the timeout math is
      triggering timeouts that are 33% too short, or so
    - proper switching logic if we're changing tcaps
    - efficiently set the timer: it only correctly sets the oneshot by
      calling the `set` function two time successively...and I have no
      idea why.
    - include logic for dispatching between tcaps with budget, instead it
      focuses on dispatching only to the current tcap's parent (see INF
      budget, above)

    Add vkernel feature for virtualization in composite
    - Added API in cos_kernel_api for copying/aliasing/moving capabilities/pages,
      which is required in initializing a newly forked component.
    - Added vkernel in no_interface as it doesn't have one. At this point, it mainly
      boots up the components(VMs) and hands them over ubenchmarking tasks.
    - Untyped memory allocation for each component is done at the end of the
      untyped_frontier for isolation in each region of memory, which will be
      simpler in memory management.

    Removed old logic for tcap_transfer
    
    We do not use the old version of transfer anymore.  It required that the sender have a uniformly higher quality than the receiver.  This seems impossible to maintain in a scheduler that coordinates at all with other schedulers.  So all places in the code that used transfer have been moved over to delegate.
    
    - Move the last use of tcap_transfer over to tcap_delegate (in tcap_merge)
    - Remove the code for tcap_transfer
    
    TCap code down to < 250 LoC.  Great!

    Activate tcap priorities.
    
    - `tcap_activate` now takes a priority that the new tcap should have.
    
    - `tcap_transfer` calls delegate, thus finds the least upper bound of
      priorities for the delegation.  The only difference between it and
      `tcap_delegate` now is that one is called on a `rcvcap_t`
      (`tcap_transfer`), which implies some degree of trust and
      integration, and the other operates on an `asndcap_t`.
    
    - General clean-up: updated more code to use the typechk macro on
      captbl lookup.
    
    - `tcap_res_t` is now an unsigned value (not cycles_t) as we don't
      want to go into negative budgets, and there were stupid issues with
      using max signed values for INF budget.

    Get rid of the distinction between user-typed memory, and kernel-typed memory at user-level.
    
    - Relies on the previous commit to use only untyped memory, and to dynamically retype it on demand based on requests coming in for kernel vs. user-memory.
    - Up the default amount of physical untyped memory that the cos_kernel_api expects (to 32 MB).
    - Now we track three bump pointers in untyped memory, and three frontiers.
    
    To fix code that this API change breaks:
    
    1. Remove the last two arguments to cos_meminfo_init.  For example: cos_meminfo_init(&booter_info.mi, BOOT_MEM_KM_BASE, COS_MEM_KERN_PA_SZ);
    2. change COS_MEM_KERN_PA_ORDER to a reasonably sized memory value.  This must have some relation to how much memory you have on the system.  Making it very large (larger than memory) will result in NULL being returned from the allocation functions, which might be quite acceptable.

    Change hw_map to also allocate the vaddr to map into.
    
    - Split the mapping/allocation function for user memory into the part
      that allocates virtual memory (valloc), and the one that
      allocates/maps memory (alloc).
    
    - Change the function prototype to not take now-superfluous virtual
      address and page-table capability.

    Add the ability to freely map to the HW interface.
    
    - Motivated by getting PCI to work if it creates a physical aperture in high physmem.
    - Add the simple ability to map in a random physical page.
    - You should _not_ use this to map in a physical page that is accessible through the normal system mechanisms.

    Optimized the captbl lookup in two ways:
    
    1. Removed the condition that checks a valid maximum capability size.
    2. Optimize for lookup of CAP_SINV capabilities by adding a single
       conditional, but inlining the constant size of the SINV cap into
       the get_leaf calculations.  Only tests will show if this is a net
       win.

    Enables IO port namespace access at user-level.
    
    This is a band-aid for now.  The rumpkernel needs port namespace
    access for PCI.  Future design:
    
    1. Enable IOPL = 3 only for select components, or
    2. Use the IO bitmask in the TSS to protect the IO namespace.

    This fixes a bug where using cos_thd_mod to set the TLS for the

    This is used in the rumpkernel to ascertain the offset of given TLS

    Added hacked in support for gs segment support for TLS.
    
    - Added a syscall to operate on a thread (through a higher-order CT) to set the TLS address for a thread.
    - Added conditional switching of that TLS address in the context switching code.
    - Cleaned up spacing in gdt.c
    - Cleaned up the segment selector defines to make the RPL obvious.
    - Updated the name of the timer inter-arrival period.

    Parsec: Initial support for namespaces.   All functionality is there beside lookups.
    
    - Allocation and deallocation protocols for all modules.
    
    - alloc/free functions for namespace sharing and reallocation
    
    - ns data-structures in ps_mem
    
    - macro expansions for ns that include both slab and smr

Author: Gabe Parmer <gparmer@gwu.edu>

    Cleaned up existing code, and added some namespace functionality.  This involved:
    
    - Adding explicit allocate/free function pointers to the slab and
      using them to change the header layout of slabs.
    
    - Removing the hintern boolean value, and replacing it with an
      explicit statement about how much space should be reserved for the
      header (0 if it is external).  This in conjunction with the function
      support above enable the namespace hijacking of the layers below the
      slab (for resuse of the namespace).
    
    - Made the slab and smr APIs take the overall memory representation
      (struct ps_mem) rather, than slab/smr specific structs.  This is
      messy, but almost required to access the local slab info, and remote
      slab info.  Same if we include the same functionality in SMR.
    
    - Provide slab functions that take the `struct ps_mem *` as an
      arguments so that we can have separately managed slabs (i.e. for
      separate namespaces of the same type).

    Micro-booter enhancement:  Added synchronous invocations.
    
    - Create a new component (sharing the same resource tables)
    - Create an sinv capability to that component
    - Add customized server-side code in inv.S and client-side code in the
      microbooter to enable the invocation to look almost exactly like a
      function call (with strange calling conventions, and using the stack
      to hold a few superfluous items).  With a little work, this could be
      made to look exactly like a function call.
    
    This serves as yet another example of how to use the kernel calling
    conventions in a different way.  This is a nice way to enable a single
    component to have portions of itself deviate in permissions from
    others.  One can make sandboxes using this facility.

    - There is some instability in the slab implementation (and SMR, but I
      think it is coming from the slab)
    
    - Some effort to make sure that we're getting the core id only once
      per call (instead of once in SMR, and once in slab).

    Parsec: Converting the crufty old slab allocator over to one that can be used with parsec.
    
    - Removed the bitmap tracking of allocation/deallocation.
    - Added a header that includes the time-stamp, and slab * + fl *
    - Freelist tracking within a slab of allocated/free memory
    - Imported the test file for the slab, and updated it
    - Backing store goes directly out to mmap/munmap currently
    - Platform abstraction layer focusing currently on Linux

    Unify interrupt handling stack layout (i.e. around `struct pt_regs`) with the system call path.
    
    - Added the console back into the system
    - Added thread id print out into the page fault handler to test that
      we have proper stack alignment on interrupt
    - Removed the dynamic interrupt vector of function pointers.  Replaced
      with irq code generation per interrupt that directly call out to the
      C handler.  We need to avoid the function pointers.
    - Added a few more guidelines to the style guide
    
    Next steps: Integrate the interrupt handlers with asnd logic to notify
    user-level of the interrupt.  This is the whole point of unifying the
    register representation.
    
    TODO:
    
    - `struct pt_regs` -> `struct registers`
    - add in interrupt handlers (even a default) for each possible irq
    - `orig_ax` -> `err_code`

    Finished Stage 4.  Fleshed out edge-cases for notifications between child/parent.
    
    These changes focused on:
    
    1. Added arcv and asnd logic to enable both behaviors where the sender
       switches immediately to reciever, and the opposite.
    2. Added event channels from child to parent to tell it a. the child
       is recieving, or not, and b. how much time it executed.  In short,
       thread status and accounting.
    
    Some additions to the style guide.

    Stage 2-3: Added the ability to return multiple values from a system call, and the ability to control the return values of threads we're just switching to if they are in a rcv.
    
    - Added a new system call mechanism that enables the returning of two
      additional values.
    - Added a new thread flag to designate if it is a rcv, which is viewed
      when switching to it, at which point its return values are
      controlled.
    - Cleaned up the system call assembly slightly.
    - Use the new system call return mechanism to implement an expanded
      rcv system that returns (currently) a couple of magic values.

    Stage 2: Added the hierarchy between event notification end-points (arcv and asnd) with pending asnd activations returned properly, but *not* arcv notifications to the parent arcv end-point (i.e. for interrupts/hierarchical scheduling).
    
    The abstraction for the event notification end-points is this:
    
    - A rcv end-point is bound to a thread.  Events trigger activations of
      that thread, and it can use the rcv capability to retrieve event
      notifications.
    - Every rcv end-point, when created, is associated with a single other
      rcv end-point, creating a child/parent relationship (the
      pre-existing rcv is the parent).  Each rcv capability is also paired
      with a single thread (and that thread to a single rcv end-point).
      The parent recieves the events of the child, enabling an
      asynchronous coordination between them.
    - Events come in three flavors.  1. asnd activations to a rcv
      end-point incriment a pending count for the rcv end-point.
      2. Interrupts trigger asnd activations.  3. Parent end-points
      receive notifications of child events such as rcv invocations with
      no pending events (i.e. the equivalent of idling), and child rcv
      thread activation.
    
    The current commit provides 1., and will trigger parent thread
    execution on idle, but no child events are enqueued with the parent.
    This is the next step.

    What works:
    
    - We can create and link up the sender and reciever.
    - We can switch from and sender to a reciever.
    - We can switch from reciever to sender when there is no pending in the rcv cap.
    
    The switch to and back from the reciever is hard-coded (i.e. no
    scheduling policy is involved).
    
    What is pending:
    
    - (Stage 2) Create a relationship between a parent and a child rcv
      capability to enable notifications of rcv when there are no pending
      events.
    - (Stage 2) In doing so, deliver notifications of the rcving threads
      "blocking" to the parent rcv capability.
    - (Stage 2) Test in microbooter.
    - (Stage 3) Additionally, add notifications for rcv threads waking on
      snd to the parent.  The intention is that schedulers will recieve
      these events, and block/wakeup threads appropriately.
    - (Stage 3) Test in the micro_booter.
    - (Stage 4) Hard-code the snd policy to _not_ switch to the activated
      thread to test the notification path for schedulers.  Add test code
      to the micro-booter.
    - (Stage 5) Create a harware capability that provides access to
      hardware resources such as interrupt lines.
    - (Stage 5) Enable this capability to be wired to a rcv capability.
    - (Stage 5) Hook the timer interrupt into this.
    - (Stage 5) Test in the microbooter.
    - (Stage 6 and beyond) Integrate tcaps.

    Fixed the thread creation logic, and hooked it into the cos_kernel_api.
    
    Important NOTES about the API:
    
    - cos_thd_alloc returns the capability for the new thread, not
      the new thread's id.
    
    - cos_initthd_alloc should not be used except to create initial
      execution in new components.
    
    - If you create more than 16 threads without executing any of them,
      then cos_thd_alloc will return 0 for an error.  In such a case, some
      of the threads should be executed before continuing allocations.
      **Always check the return value**.

    Modified the micro_booter to add some basic tests for cos_kernel_api.
    
    - Tests for thread creation, switching, and page allocation.
    - Cleaned up the linker to require that there is _no_ component 0.
    - Added a platform/i386/runscripts/ directory for hardware booter runscripts
    - Cleaned up the thread creation facilities (cos_thd_init_alloc in cos_thd_init.h)
    - Still debugging the upcall path to do proper thread creation.

    Added the library for low-level, user-level access to the kernel API.
    The library:
    
    - Transparently allocates memory and capabilities
    - Provides "high-level" APIs to create the various kernel objects (but
      not the *cons* operations which are made transparent).
    - Abstracts between components created by a booter, and the booter's
      structures itself that are providing the resources (see
      ci_resources)
    
    The library assumes:
    
    - bump-pointer allocation of all resources
    - a separation of kernel and use memory regions (can be somewhat
      easily removed in the future)
    - no deallocation of resources (reasonable in the booters, maybe
      less-so in the memory manager)
    
    The library has incomplete stubs to be completed in the future for
    many of the "actions" on capabilities.  For example, memory mapping,
    invocation, asnd activation, etc...  These will be fleshed out on
    demand.

    Added the ability of the llbooter to expand to larger than 4MB.
    
    Additional PTEs needed to be hooked up into the PGD as the heap
    pointer passed into the next 4MB region.  This code adds that to
    get_pmem(), so that it is transparently added.
    
    Additional small cleanups to remove trailing whitespace.

    Fixed a page-table mapping bug in the kernel.
    
    In *_mapping_add, we didn't check for the NULL-ness of the lookup of
    the pte in the destination page-table.  This fix adds the NULL check.

    Progress in booting up the low-level booter.  Gets to "done creating
    system".
    
    Bug fixes:
    
    Fixed a bug to get debugging flags working.  CK uses a __builtin* for
    bit population counting, and its implementation in libgcc uses
    _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_ (i.e. it is PIC).  The "fix" is to comment out
    the usage of the builtin function, and cause a fault instead.
    
    Fixed a bug due to incorrect heap meta-data in the llbooter object
    resulting in faults upon boot.  A simple update of a heap pointer
    fixed that.

    but pulls in cbuf. Cause the cbuf version of SS_ipc_client_fault to

    HW Boot: Booting to user-level works
    
    - Mapped in dyanmic #'s of PTEs, and the memory for the boot
      component, for the kernel memory region, and for the user-level
      region.
    
    - sysexit to the llboot's entry address (sched_init_inv).
    
    - Systematically provide an interface to the different memory ranges
      (i.e. the memory layout).

    cbboot: add a new component booter intended to nest below boot
    
    The cbboot currently uses the same primary mechanisms as boot,
    but its goal eventually is to use cbufs as the backing memory
    for components that it boots. The unit_cbboot_cbuf.sh script
    is identical to unit_cbuf.sh except for using the cbboot to load
    the test component objects.

    cos_loader: enable additional boot layers
    
    Call make_spd_boot on subsequent boot layers past 1. The
    booters need to be invoked in reverse order in case their
    component memory changes. Also create the boot schedule
    for each layer, and assume that dependencies are satisfied
    if another booter should load it. Note: the logic for
    checking dependencies in spd_already_loaded() should be
    made more robust by checking if the service is loaded by
    an earlier layer in the boot sequence.

    cinfo: +cinfo_add(), +cinfo_alloc(), +cinfo_spdid(), -cinfo_get_spdid()
    
    Introduce cinfo_add() with cinfo_spdid() to identify the server
    and cinfo_alloc() to support setting up the memory page used
    by cinfo_add(). Get rid of cinfo_get_spdid() and remove iterations
    that attempt to map all component cinfos. Instead, cinfo is mapped
    on-demand.

    Fixed some issues:
    
    1) When activating kernel objects, we activate kmem first, then the
    capability. If the cap_activation failed, we need to go back and
    release the activated kmem page.
    
    2) When deactivate a pgd, only scan the user space range to make sure
    no mapping left.
    
    3) When deactivate a cap_cap, set the ref_cnt to 0 AND keep the frozen
    flag to avoid any further operation on it.

    Added the u64_t deact_tsc field to the capability header: it's the
    time stamp for the deactivation time of the capability entry. Since we
    need it for all types of capabilities (even for core-local caps like
    threads), it's integrated in the header.
    
    The 64-bit tsc changes the sizes of most types of capabilities. Fixed
    many places that assume the size of capability entries.
    
    Todo: a cap id allocation mechanism in the llboot for the low-level
    components loaded by llboot.
    
    Possible issue: we have a deact_tsc in each cap entry. However, when
    we re-use the cacheline for a different type of capability, we may
    need to check all TSCs in the cacheline.

    Changed the default NCPU to 1. Tested the low-level ping-pong IPC
    benchmark, which is the only working script for the new system right
    now.
    
    Commented out the high-level booter as it doesn't compile at the
    moment, because it shares booter.c with low-level booter..
    
    Fixed a few warnings.

    - Added a main .c file that includes all logic for capability
      invocation at the system call level
    - Changed the logic for the creation of asnd capabilities by removing
      the component capability -- instead we use the existing component
      information in the arcv capability
    - Added retyping logic from COSFRAME memory in page-tables into kernel

    Tried to implement per-core freelist for stacks but didn't
    finish. Need to move on to the benchmark for the PPOS paper next.
    
    An issue regarding the per-core freelist: when we have multiple
    freelists declared in the cos_comp_info structure, the system fails in
    llbooter. Going to figure it out when coming back to this.

    Added cos_get/put_curr_thd functions in kernel. They save and retrieve
    information from the cos_cpu_local_info structure on kernel
    stack. They replaced the core_get/put_* functions, which use per_cpu
    variables (which also means one more TLB access).

    Right now, they are all in platform/tests/ppos/ for the most part, and
    the shell of most of the capcap operations will be implemented there.
    For now, we want to get the data-structures right, and iterate from

    Changed sysenter_esp to point to the sp0, instead of TSS. This
    avoids touching the TSS page (TLB!) in Composite sysenter
    interposition path. However, this complicates things:
    
    -- now in the interposition path, we get sp0 in esp right
       away. Efficient and simple.
    -- but for Linux syscalls, they expect TSS in esp, no sp0. We need to
       restore TSS for them.
    -- in order to do so, we store orig_sysenter_esp in struct
       cos_cpu_local_info, which is at the lowest address of kernel stack
       page (Linux thread_info struct is there too).
    -- and in interposition path, we restore esp from orig_sysenter for
       Linux path.
    
    Now Composite path doesn't have to suffer TSS accessing
    overhead. Awesome!
    
    Also, added several sanity checks related to Linux thread_info
    struct. Future proof.

    1) Fixed a bug of the new thread creation API. I used to integrate the
    init_data (index for the init data entry) into the first
    sched_param. In that case, the bits belong to init_data could be
    random value when using legacy method to create thread. Changed it to
    integrate init_data with spdid - now the first parameter is init_data
    << 16 | spdid. This way it works for both legacy and new APIs.
    
    2) Fixed the lws_static script. Web server loads correctly. Probably
    still won't handle requests (which is an old issue).

    Added captbl initial implementation.
    
    Still has a few too many branches, and uses the default access/modify
    routines, but this is a decent first draft.
    
    TODO:
    - Remove branches for tree walking
    - figure out how to get the redundant != NULL and < maxid checks out of the binary
    - concurrency-safe modifications
    - Capabilities of different sizes

    ertrie enhancements:  moved all access functions (including initfn and isnull) to operate on pointers, rather than return values
    
    The previous commit (forgot to mention) enables the generic set and
    get of the actual leaf values (e.g. dereference the pointers in the
    default implementation).

    ertrie updates: finally works again after further generalization.
    
    The main change here is that I added functions for getting and setting
    the leaf entries (i.e. not the leaf internal nodes, but the actual
    entries within those leaf internal nodes).  By default, these entries
    are just treated as pointers.

    1) Implemented new IPI sending/receiving mechanism. Now we have our
    own IRQ line for IPIs. On the sending part, we don't use Linux
    low-level functions anymore since they use spinlock + linked-list. We
    use customized point-to-point lock-free ring buffer to avoid locks and
    achieve minimal cache migration between cores. Changed acaps to use
    new mechanism.
    
    2) New thread creation method. To create a new thread, a component
    needs to allocate a local thread entry (which includes a function
    pointer and a data pointer), and pass the index of the entry to
    scheduler. The scheduler then passes the index to the newly created
    thread, which will use the index to access the entry function and
    data. The benefit of this approach is, the scheduler won't be able to
    control the entry points of client components (and thus not able to
    cause fault in them). The behavior of new threads in a component is
    defined by that component only.
    
    3) In the scheduler, new created thread will upcall into the
    destination component directly, instead of upcalling into scheduler
    first.

    Removed brand mechanism completely. All brand-related functions,
    definitions and thread states are removed. The term "brand" is now
    behind us. Only a few comments (in inv.c) still use term "brand" as
    they might still provide useful information.
    
    Also, changed a tsc to per-core.

    A few updates:
    1) Replaced brands with acaps. Changed (a) timer, (b) network and (c) translator (LtoC) components to use acaps. Tested all.
    2) Change ck from a submodule to actual tracked files in Composite. This way the ck repository availability issues wouldn't affect us.
    3) Some OpenMP changes.

    Adding Lua support to composite.  Note that *there are still two changes required* before anyone can use Lua:
    
    1. `components/implementation/lua_keyval` should move to `components/implementation/tests/lua_keyval/`.
    
    2. It currently uses the Linux system calls to read in the scripts.  So we should change that by simply loading in the scripts (currently) at compile time using `#include`.

    Added an owner_thd to each client acap. 0 means no owner. Also,
    changed the IPI handler thread in the scheduler to use acap instead of
    brand. Tested and worked!

    Added ainv_wait and wakeup (chal_attempt_ainv) support based on brand_
    implementation.
    
    Also, added static invocation support in the ainv stub. So when acap
    manager lookup returns a static cap, the client thread will do static
    inv correctly.

    TCaps: Fixed the scheduler hierarchical interface to remove the use of
    the shared data region.  Now it uses the support recently added for
    treadp to return multiple arguments.  This includes adding new stubs
    for the sched_hier interface.

    TCaps: budget accounting + replenishing, splitting, and separate tcaps for interrupts and threads (for a single scheduler.
    
    1) Budget accounting and replenishment.  On thread switches, the
    budget is update.  Also, we make sure that the tcap we switch to is a)
    not expired, and b) has budget left.  On timer-ticks the persistent
    tcap for the scheduler is replenished.
    
    2) Splitting to create new tcaps (pooled and non) works.  This
    exercizes the tcap_transfer path.
    
    3) The scheduler has been adapted to include three new tcaps for a)
    timer interrupt, b) network interrupt, and c) normal execution.  They
    have appropriate priorities.  These priorities are currently ignored.
    
    NOTE: I had to hack the first timer tick: The budget is twice a timer
    tick.  For some reason between tick 0 and 1, the tick length is more
    than a timer tick.  Don't really know why.

    Clean up composite boot/shutdown, fix bugs in the booter/loader.
    
    1) Fix up the initialization/teardown of the composite
    creation/destruction process.  The intention is to enable us to simply
    run the scripts multiple times rather than have to reinsert the
    module.  Alas, now it just double faults when you try and run the
    scripts twice.  Later.
    
    2) Jiguo Song contributed a fix to the cos_loader to properly calcuate
    section offsets
    
    3) John Wittrock contributed code to properly track the end of each
    component's memory pages in the booter.

    Client-side support for multiply sized cbufps.  Currently using a
    power-of-two allocator that adds about 14 cycles (no branches) to
    allocation to determine the freelist to use.  These freelist sizes are
    integrated into the cbufp manager.
    
    Additionally, we've improved, and expanded the bitmap.h utility file
    and use it for the power of two computations.
    
    Included are unit tests/microbenchmarks that show the cost of cached
    versus uncached access.

    Phase 1: Making the composite hardware abstraction layer (chal) explicit.
    
    Goal: move all platform specific code from hijack.c and kernel/*.c
    into kernel/include/chal.h (prototypes), platform/include/chal_plat.h
    (static inline functions), and platform/linux/module/pgtbl.c (and
    others, for globally visible functions).
    
    Moved all page table specific code to pgtbl.c in hijack.  Started
    moving functions into chal.h and changing their names at all call
    points.

    Added logic for two new sections:  .cinfo (the component information page), and .kmem (data-structures that must be kernel-visible).
    
    The cinfo section is used to find the cinfo page.
    
    The kmem section is currently not used, but will be (e.g. by John) for
    identifying which pages must be kernel visibile (e.g. user-level
    capability pages, scheduler event notification pages, etc...)

    Added new object sections including ctor, dtor, crecov, and cinfo.  Also included support for using these sections (i.e. placing functions pointers in them).
    
    See cos_component.h for CCTOR, CDTOR, and CRECOV to set a function as
    belonging to one of these classes.  If it is constructor, then it will
    be called on bootup before cos_init.  If it is a destructor, it is
    currently not called.  Jiguo will need to add support so that when a
    recovery upcall is called, it will invoke the recovery handlers
    (i.e. this is used as a notification of needed recovery.
    
    If you define your own cos_init, then you should call
    constructors_execute yourself.

    Remove the scheduler notifications page from non-schedulers.
    
    Previously the `cos_sched_notifications` page was a manditory part of
    every component.  This blew up the BSS by a page.  Not the end of the
    world, and we've avoided caring about it up till now.  However, this
    will add the cost of zeroing out a page for recovery of
    non-schedulers.  We'd like to avoid this if possible.  This commit
    removes it, and instead adds a `cos_sched_ds.h` file that includes the
    data-structure itself.  Almost no component should have to include
    this manually as if you're writing a scheduler, you should inherit the
    scheduler interface which will include it automatically.

    Phase 2 of loader improvements done: general creation of objects from
    a sections specification.
    
    - The actual creation of objects is done through loops through the
      section specification.
    
    - The sections specification includes all possible sections, which are
      created for each objects, but actually result in real memory being
      used on when that section is present.
    
    - The size and address specifications are generated programmatically
      rather than in a hard-coded manner.
    
    - Code is now cleaner and easier to understand.  load_service is
      actually hackable now.
    
    TODO: remove special cases of the non-composite-booted components.
    Just produce cobjs for all of them and later load the memory manually.

    Loader improvements intermediate phase.  Tediously going through the
    load_service function and first mimicing the current code with that
    which uses the new cos_section structure, and then migrating that to
    code that does it the right way.  Because of this, I'm writing two
    times as much code as I'd expect, but it is the only way to debug.

    First phase of loading improvements:  partial cos_loader->generic section loading + non-partitioned mem{cpy|set} to initialize components.
    
    1) First phases of adding a generic mechanism for adding new sections
    to the loading process.  Will be used in phase 3 (thereabouts) to add
    initonce sections, and in phase 4 to add a kernel-mapped section.
    Later, we can add the .cons and .dtor sections, etc...
    
    2) In the composite booter, we used to do memcpy and memset page at a
    time.  This slowed down the processing as it messed with the
    processor's prefetcher.  Much better to simply memcpy or memset the
    entire section we are trying to initialize.  This is done in this
    patch.  Note that one wouldn't typically care to optimize this, but
    when we want to do fast component micro-rebooting, it matters.
    
    3) I moved the cos_component.c library file from a library-loaded
    file, to a manditory-included file.  We assume that all components
    have a cos_comp_info page.  TODO: remove the scheduler notification
    page from this, and place it in scheduler-specific manditory-include
    library files.  This will save a page per component (of kernel-shared
    memory).

    Added the get_cpuid_fast() function, which is only used in the
    invocation path to get the current cpuid while optimizing for
    uniprocessor performance.
    
    The reason that we have a seperate _fast function is because:
    (Complicated...)
    
    1) We want to optimize the uniprocessor case, which means we should
    have the get_cpuid function returns a constant 0 when cpuid == 1.
    
    2) The get_cpuid function is also used by the hijack module and
    
    3) We need to do hijacking on all cores, even Composite only uses a
    single core. (Want to change this!)
    
    As a consequence, when NUM_CPU is 1, the get_cpuid function cannot
    both be optimized for the uniprocessor(return 0) and reflect actual
    CPU id in the hijack code for cores other than 0. Thus we have the
    get_cpuid function to return actual value always, and the _fast
    function to optimize for performance. Currently it's only used in the
    invocation path.

    Added user-level handers for the divide-by-zero fault.
    
    Other fault handlers can easily be added by following the
    divide-by-zero fault handler's example.  They can be added to the
    faults inteface, and implemented in the stack trace fault handler.
    
    This was added in expectation that the fault tolerance work will
    require invalid instruction, stack segment errors, etc... exception
    handlers.  This should make adding those easy.

    First version of cbufp.  Does NOT work, but maintains backwards
    compatibility with tmem cbufs without performance degradation.  All
    unit_* and micro_* scripts still work.
    
    Next steps are to add runscripts for testing cbufps, and continue with
    development.  The limitations are below, and they need to be phased
    out.
    
    1) created the cbufp component.
    
    2) changed cbuf.h to include both cbufs and cbufps.  Calls to the
       separate back ends are made by simply using conditionals in the
       code, and setting the variables that change the conditions in
       outer, static inlined functions.  Relying on function inlining,
       constant propagation and dead code elimination to maintain native
       performance.
    
    3) The cbufp component is dependent on the cbuf component as it uses
       cbufs to deliver the list of cbufps to the client that it can use.
    
    4) Limitations of current code:
       - Only works for <= PAGE_SIZE allocations
       - Does not do intelligent allocation of the number of required
         bufps.
       - Does not do intelligent asynchronous garbage collection (by
         setting RELINQUISH in the cbuf_meta).
       - Does not currently integrate with the memory management of the
         system at large.  Does not integrate with any policy component.

    cbuf commit #1:  toward persistent cbufs.
    
    1) Changed cbuf retrieve to pass all relevant data in the cbuf_meta,
       and set the flags according to the characteristics of the specific
       memory.  The client library uses these flags to do sanity checking
       to make sure what it think is tmem is, and what it thinks isn't,
       isn't.
    
    2) Added an additional argument to the cbuf.h operations to denote if
       we are doing the operation on tmem or not.  Functions are provided
       that have this statically set to either 0 or 1, so that constant
       propagation and dead code elimination will optimize the code just
       as if we wrote separate paths.  The cost is that the code is a
       little uglier, and more difficult to follow.  There's no way to
       avoid this, as far as I can see.
    
    3) In the cbuf component, we changed the cbid vector to track
       cos_cbuf_items instead of cbuf_descs.  Additionaly moved the
       pointer to the cbuf_meta structure that used to be in the item,
       into the cbuf_mapping structure so that we can track the cbuf_metas
       for _all_ components the cbuf is mapped into, rather than just the
       owner.
    
    4) Add multiplexing code into cbuf.c to handle tmem and persistent
       cbufs differently.  Initial version of cbufp_grant, cbufp_collect,
       and cbufp_return for mapping a persistent cbuf into an address
       space.

    Fixed a issue that clobbers registers when call brand_wait
    syscall. Now all the registers are saved in the user space before
    calling syscall. So we only need to make sure the IP and SP are
    saved and restored appropriately.
    
    The IPI syscall is very stable now - I tried calling it millions of
    times and everything looks good. However I only tested with single
    caller and single receiver. Will test multicore calling at the same
    time next.

    Implemented a first step of IPI syscall. The syscall makes use of
    Linux smp_call function. Currently it's not fast yet.(around 2200
    cycles) Going to measure the cost further and see how much we can do.
    
    Also, fixed a problem that children processes cannot return to their
    original pgd. (Thanks Gabe!) Now the SMP system is re-runnable.

    Implemented a new low-level printc component, which doesn't require
    shared region between components for passing the string. Instead, we
    use only 4 registers (4 parameters) as medium. Thus we need to call
    llprintc component multiple times. Of course this will effect print
    performance, but we need to get rid of the shared region.
    
    Tested the llprintc with two timer threads. Worked well!
    
    Going to change the trans print component.

    Integrated with low-level booter - now we can boot Composite with
    SMP. System can boot and run with no problem. Each core has their own
    timer threads. All the booter loaded components / threads are assigned
    to core 0, i.e. not changed yet. But I don't see why we can't
    partition or schedule them to multicore, which we are really
    interested in.
    
    Got some issues with printc. Next I'm going to change the current
    printc implementation to a low-level print implementation, which gets
    rid of the shared region between components.

    Multicore Composite update:
    
    1) Invocation works finally. Now multiple threads running on multiple
    cores are able to call from cos_loader to scheduler. In cos_loader the
    first init thread forks new processes for other cores. New threads
    will call scheduler and waiting there.
    
    2) Modified some data structures in scheduler and hijack code to
    support SMP.
    
    3) Kernel per-core data structure is added. Corresponding operations
    are added too. (per_cpu.c and per_cpu.h)
    
    4) Kernel and user-level get_cpuid functions are added. (kernel:
    get_cpuid(), user: cos_cpuid())
    
    Have some issues with upcall functions.

    Next commit in the low-level booter series.  Now both the low-level booter, and the normal booter work together to create a executable system.
    
    Changes include:
    - In the cos_loader, we now enable the booter cobj to have an
      additional section appended to it including 1) all other objects it
      is supposed to load, and 2) scheduling, initial argument, etc
      information.
    - The llbooter now properly allocates physical memory to the memory
      manager, and will proportionately split physical memory between any
      components that want to do memory management.
    - The scheduler interface now includes a separate sched_hier interface
      that is used for the hierarchical composition of schedulers.  The
      llbooter is the root scheduler, the memory manager is a child, and
      the main scheduler is a child of that.
    - The cobj format now enables specific symbols at virtual addresses to
      be found in the cobject itself (used for looking up and modifying
      the component information page).
    - The main system scheduler now becomes a scheduler through the
      sched_hier interfaces.
    - Added runscripts for testing the composition of booters
      (unit_booters.sh).

      (hard-coded) scheduling, and printing.
    - Modified the cpu hog component to instead print and return to test
      the configuration.
    - comp0 now invokes the llbooter.
    - Scheduler parent/child relationships are now manually created upon
      scheduler initialization by using the interface, as it should ahve
      been from the start.
    - Separated the scheduler interface into sched.h and sched_hier.h.

    Commit 2 in the low-level boot series: add page frame number restrictions to spds.
    
    A component's page frame numbers that it can reference are constrained
    now by checks in cos_mmap_cntl(GRANT...).  An spd can be given access
    to map a given contiguous extent of physical memory.  By default,
    components that are booted by Linux have access to all of physical
    memory, while others have no access.  System calls (cos_pfn_cntl) are
    provided to grant a page range for a component to map/unmap.

    Step 1 toward a low-level booter (llboot).
    
    The goal of this string of commits is to provide a low-level boot
    component that will load _all_ other components (including the normal
    boot component).  The has three purposes:
    
    1. Since only a single component is required to boot an arbitrarily
       large system (given enough memory for that single component), it
       becomes easier to boot from the bare-metal as during system boot
       up, we only need to create a single component without any
       capabilities.  A later step will include serializing this component
       image to disk so that it can be loaded as a ramdisk via the
       multi-boot standard (i.e. as a module).
    
    2. Fault tolerance: If we want to be able to recover from faults in
       the lowest-level components such as the memory manager and the
       scheduler, then we have to have some component that can trap the
       errors, and reboot the offending component.  This is the low-level
       booter.  Support for e.g. fault handling will be included in a
       later commit.
    
    3. To provide a low-level execution environment for the most
       timing-critical of components.  When abstractions such as the
       scheduling layer, the memory manager, file systems, stack
       management, event management, etc... entail too much overhead, and
       an application wants full access to the hardware, it can be booted
       by the low-level boot component.
    
    Care was taken to keep the llboot component relatively small.
    Discounting data-structures, and other generic code, the component is
    less than 500 lines of code, and is very specialized around its
    purpose.  In spite of this, it does share the majority of its code
    with the normal boot component.
    
    Currently the system does _not use the llboot_ component.  This commit
    maintains backwards compatibility with existing runscripts, while
    changing the way that scheduler intialization works (so that it can be
    done for the root scheduler via upcall), and adds the necessary
    support in the llboot component for future functionality.  To do the
    latter, I had to separate out some of the normal and current
    functionality for the boot component into boot_dep.h; a change that
    is, again, backwards compatible.

    Reworking of the synchronization code to put the fast path into the .h file to be inlined, and keep the slow paths in the .c file.  Attempt to optimize cbuf operations, but the locks add on 90-120 cycles on an atom processor.  Just going to live with it now.
    
    1) Move lock fast path into .h file, and inline it.
    2) Separate the slow path into the library file.
    3) Fix bugs related to cbuf locking: put the actual lock in a .c
       library file, rather than a .h file (in the cbuf component).
    4) Remove some of the print crap from our RTSS binge.

    Solved a problem that was caused by the wake_cnt. Before in the tmem
    code the current thd need to wake up itself if thd dependency didn't
    work. Now in the scheduler code the pre_wakeup is done automatically
    if there's something wrong with the dependency. Thus no need to wake
    up itself anymore.

    1) Added CBUFM_MAPPED_IN flag in cbuf meta to help the inconsistency
       check when cbuf2buf happens
    
       CBUF_MAPPED_IN is used to deal with the following situation:
    
       A mapped cbuf accidentally matches the previous left old descriptor
       (e.g., allocated before then freed. And now both cbid and address
       are same) in a component.  The component thought the cbuf was
       eligible to allocate again -- lead to inconsistency
    
    2) Clean up and reorgonize the implementation/tests. Added micro_stack

    Large commit focusing on synchronization/dependency fixes.
    
    - First load tests with the multi-threaded server that uncovered quite
      a few errors.  Required a complete rewrite of the client-side lock
      code to be 1) compiler friendly, and 2) use actual atomic
      instructions.
    
    - Fixed the synchronization in the torrentified networking stack.
    
    - Updated some ioctls to 2.6.36...hopefully this doesn't break 2.6.33.

    component can export the reporting functionality.
    3) added fine-grained synchronization to the http component.

    1) Fixed nasty bug on system exit: memory was being freed incorrectly
    causing random system/application crashes, and 2) torrentified the
    rest of the networking stack.
    
    1) I was freeing pages back to linux using __free_pages.  That
    function assumed it was taking a struct page as an argument.  Whoops.
    Now using free_pages.  Fun to debug that one.
    
    2) The TCP->IP and IP->netif interactions are all now torrentified.
    Currently we are reallocating cbufs at each invocation level for tmem.
    This should be changed in the future to pass cbufs that have not been
    modifed on to the next level without reallocation.

    Implemented a new intelligent waking up scheme in the tmem manager.
    
    The new waking up procedure is: 1) low thread release the lock, then
    wake up the highest thread, which is the last one on the block
    list. 2) the highest thread wake up the rest ones on the block list,
    without releasing the lock.
    
    A epoch counter is added to determine whether a thread should be wake
    up by the current thread.
    
    Some other fix: fixed the priority of the timer thread in timed event
    component. fixed the priority issue in the synth hier component.

    Added the evt_split function to the event interface, a new
    edge-triggered event manager that is simpler, and provides a better
    interface for waiting on multiple events, and changed the runscripts
    to use it.
    
    Specifically: When a new event is created, you must specify (using
    evt_split) which other event is this new event's parent, and if this
    event is a "group" or a normal event.  Group events can have new
    events split off of them, and we can wait on the group.  This will
    yield wait returning the event id of the child event that triggered
    the event.  A tree of these groups can be defined.
    
    Warning: The asymtotic complexity of these calls is proportionate to
    the _depth_ of the group hierarchy.

    The http and sync_tconn (new connector) are now torrents.  Next, the
    networking stack.
    
    1) http component is now torrentified.  It is suboptimal in that it
       does not re-use the cbuf passed for read/write
    2) connection manager is now half torrentified (not the net side).
       the _pack read and write functions are used fairly extensively,
       thus room for optimization
    3) fixed bugs in the cbuf_vect implementation in cbuf2buf
    4) fixed bugs in the stack trace fault handler with frame-pointer alignment
    5) removed the function to remove a stack that has been introspected
       from the stkmgr's interface.  Instead just done using the memory
       manager

    Actually fixed the booter problem with expanding address space.  Last
    fix was crap.  Now we update the mpd with the current spd's page table
    mappings.
    
    Added small amount of code to the page-fault handler to check if the
    current composite page-table does _not_ include the mapping, and the
    spd's page-table does.  If this is the case, update the spd's
    page-table.

    Found TLB coherency issue, and hacked a fix that needs to be fixed later.
    
    In the booter, when we go beyond the initial 4MB region, the next page
    that is touched (that has already been mapped) will fault with a "page
    not present" fault.  The page tables are setup fine, both at the pgd
    and the pte level.  Flushing the TLB solves the issue (thus I added a
    COS_MMAP_TLBFLUSH flag).  Currently, the tlb is flushed after the
    pages are mapped in, but before they are accessed, and it works.  The
    only way this really makes sense is if invocations aren't going
    through the kernel (i.e. which should flush the TLB).  However, even
    in that case, there should be no TLB mapping for the missing page that
    is not active, thus the TLB should not include a "not present" page.
    To make it more confusing, the system works for any allocations made
    within the same pgd (4MB region) -- thus the "in same protection
    domain" theory is wrong -- and it only fails when we go to another pgd
    entry.
    
    Who knows?

    Removed the sched_conf component.  Made integrating a tarball easier.
    Boot component must now be the 4th component listed in the runscript.
    
    1) Removed sched_conf component.  Currently, scheduler parameters
    aren't used (except when a thread is made intentionally from within a
    component).  Additionally, there is no mechanism for passing initial
    arguments currently.  They are in the booter component, but are
    currently unused.  Since the sched_conf has been removed, a typical
    list of non-composite loaded components is "c0.o, ;*fprr.o, ;mm.o,
    ;boot.o, ;print.o, ;".  Note that the boot component now has to be the
    4th listed component.
    
    2) The initf components now do not have their tarball loaded by the
    loader, and instead by object pasting hacks.  The initfs/initf.simple
    component is now just another compsite-loaded component.
    
    We now only have the 4 non-composite-loaded components.  Victory!

    Scheduling of the creation of threads for components on boot-up.  If
    you want an initial thread, then simply depend on the scheduler.
    WARNING: breaks backwards compatibility in that thread priorities are
    now ignored.  If you want to create a thread with specific priorities,
    call sched_create_thread explicitly.
    
    Added a new data-area that is used to pass the schedule to the booter,
    and it creates threads in this order.  We wanted to maintain some
    backwards compatibility: Components that wish to use the boot up
    thread to continue computation can do so.  The thread within the
    booter is at a lower priority, so if the initialization thread in the
    new components blocks, only then will the next thread be created.
    This does imply that if you block during initialization, then you
    could recieve invocations after that point.  This seems like a
    practically OK trade-off for now (i.e. most initialization should be
    done without blocking).

    Duplication of normal components works.  Duplication of components in an aggregate component is a wip due to needing to duplicate the deps

    CFuse enhancements.  Now the haskell EDSL does everything except
    proper cluster rendering, dependency generation with aggregate
    components, runscript output, and checking for cycles.  All the
    big-item features are there: restriction, duplication, aggregate
    components.

    Torrent support for the tar file-system.  The torrent.tar_ro component
    implements a read only file system that accesses the files in an
    initial file system (from initfs that has the initial tarball).
    
    NOT tested with large files yet.
    
    Next: initial component arguments.

    Added compile-time checking for interface dependency completeness.
    The dependencies required by a component must be satisified by their
    expressed dependencies.  Errors are emitted in the case where there
    are insufficiently provided dependencies.
    
    This step makes explicit the lists of exported functions (in
    .fn_depenencies) and the list of exported functions by an interface
    (in .fn_exports).  These will be used to define the types of
    individual nodes in cfuse.

    Rewrite of the cbuf client-side code.  Removed the slabs, and
    simplified the logic.  Now all allocations are the size of a page.  In
    the future, we will include multi-page requests, but never sub-page.
    That can be provided by user-level libraries if required.  Please run
    unit_cbuf.sh to test.
    
    This provides a good study in removing complexity.
    
    TODO includes adding microbenchmarks to the cbuf unit tests.  Given
    the reduction in complexity, the use of cvect where possible, and the
    removal of many data-structure walks in the cbuf_vect, I'd expect this
    to be roughly 4 times faster than the previous code.

    This commit got out of control.  Includes: small cbuf fixes, addition
    of the torrents for printing, and terminal entry that are UNTESTED
    because cbufs are broken.  Includes cbuf unit tests that are also
    currently broken.  The next step is simply removing sub-page cbufs.
    
    Summary: this commit adds almost no functionality that actually works.
    I have to start at the end of the dependencies, the cbufs, and fix
    backwards to get the torrents working.  See future commits.
    
    Added to documentation:  the FAQ and TODO list.

    1) Composite support for printing to a shared ring buffer and event
    notification of a linux process.
    
    2) A linux process (print) that reads from the ring buffer and outputs
    to the terminal.  This process must be run before the runscript.
    
    3) A kernel module that sets up shared mappings and sends events to
    print.
    
    4) Updated the documents on how to execute the system.

    Main memory mapper now is synchronized.
    
    The main memory mapping component (using the improved mapping
    data-structure) is now synchronized.  This was difficult as it had to
    become the root scheduler so that it could use the synchronization
    facilities of a scheduler, while still enabling the real root
    scheduler to still maitain the ability to e.g. create threads.
    
    The main memory mapper is now in a great state with very few FIXMEs to
    be done aside from fixing the inevitable bugs.

    Translator: Added the first, non-function version of the linux<->cos
    communication functionality.
    
    The translator is meant to enable shared memory and event-based
    communication between Linux processes and composite (when booted using
    the hijack techniques).  This commit includes the groundwork for
    sharing a meg region between both worlds.  The next commits will
    include:
    - make the current code work and test it
    - provide event notification via file-descriptors from Composite to
      Linux
    - provide event notification from Linux to Composite by creating
      synthetic upcalls into composite.

    Changed the loader and booter to increase the virtual address allocation to the booter.
    
    Loader now checks for the booter and simply allocates it an empty hole immediately after its vas allocation.  The booter component now immediately attempts to claim that hole on bootup.

    Things that have been done when this git log is created
    
      1. Fix one bug in cbuf. When a local cached cbuf item is used (not
         relinquished), its all previous mapped components info should be
         kept in the mapping list correctly. Either policy(remove spared)
         or cbuf_delete will eventually remove cbuf item and its all
         mapping relationship.
    
      2. Some untracked files have been added by git now.
    
    Next:
      1. Integrate with Qi's memory pool.
      2. Work with pool and stk manager together
      3. Some change in policy

    Several things at this point:
    
     1. Use symbolic file (tmem.c and tmem.h) for two managers. Basically
        stack manager is using a soft linked file from cbuf manager
     2. Now they both use sti->ci.spd_cinfo_page to access their spd info
        page
     3. One problem left is relinquish setting for the entire
        spd. Different manager should use different value to distinguish this
        bit, but it is not easy to take out and put into tmem
     4. One bug in cbuf_free is fixed so that add_to_freelist is
        guranteeded to be called even the size of cbuf is more than one page.
        Now the cost of cbuf_alloc is reduced from 6000 to 500
     5. Conversion between cbuf id and meta index is wrapped into a function now

    A few things have been fixed and tested:
      1. A component has a global variable relinquish_mark used to mark
         the entire spd to relinquish or not
      2. Function shoud_mark_relinquish and should_unmark_relinquish are
         implemented to support tmem
      3. Fix the obj_sz for cbuf_meta so that a cbuf can be between 128KB
         to a page
      4. Diffrerentiate the global blcoked threads in a specific spd and
         in all other spds when the threads are woken up
      5. Lazily removal of slab is implemented so that a deleted cbuf/id
         in manager won's have a mismatched slab in client anyway
      6. Now stack manager and cbuf manager's common part have been
         abstracted into tmem.c and tmem.h. In transient memory model, this
         should be symbolic only
      7. Tested with simple 3 layer model and synth-herical model for cbuf
         manager. Now ready to test with memory pool model

      2. Data structure spd_cbvect_range (link list) and its operation are implemeted in manager
         to track cbufs mapped bwtween clients and server  -- tested
    
      3. cbuf2buf (cache_miss and cbuf_retrieve) have been implemented and tested. Curretly, both
         server and client have 2 level structured vectors.   -- tested
    
      4. cbuf_free (cbuf_delete) is implemented without reference counting. Currently, when onwer's
         cbuf is removed, all mapped cbufs in other spds are also removed  -- testing
    
      5. PIP implementation is supported. Currently thread id is saved right next to the cbuf meta
         in vector. There are potential race condition when update these values  -- testing
    
      6. Most part of cbuf manager has been integrated into transient memory scheme,
         but there is no policy and memory pool yet.  -- To be continued

    Interfaces now can have dependencies. Stkmgr does not return any address from
    grant function. Fixed bugs of cbuf.
    
    1) Interfaces can have DEPENDENCIES in the Makefile. This is useful
    for interfaces that depend on other interfaces, eg. cbuf interface
    depends on valloc and mem_mgr_large interfaces.
    
    2) Instead of returning the address of a stack, stkmgr just add the
    stk into local free-list, and the thread returns from stkmgr and gets
    the stack from local free-list. This can unify interfaces and avoid
    some race conditions.
    
    3) cbuf uses valloc now. Fixed the bug of object size calculation.

    2) tmem_tk.h declares functions implemented in the tmem lib and
    functions need to be implemented in the manager.
    
    3) tmem.c implements functions that need to call manager.
    
    4) specific data structures need to be defined in tmem_conf.h, which
    should be placed in the interface dir.

    Changed stack manager to use valloc instead of incrementing heap
    pointer every time. Scheduler now supports nested lock, eg. take
    valloc component lock while holding stack manager lock.
    
    1) Stack manager, timed event and lock components use mem_mgr_large
    interface as they use valloc and malloc.
    
    2) Add a ncs_held to the thread structure. It keeps the number of
    critical sections that are held by the thread.
    
    3) Valloc component uses the lock provided by scheduler rather than
    lock component as this can avoid depending on lock component.

    Implemented self-suspension components detection. Changed both Stack
    Manager and Stack Policy to ensure allocating enough stacks to
    self-suspension components.
    
    1) Add a self-suspension counter to each component in Stack
    Manager. Increase the counter when we can't find any thread to depend
    on, which means all threads are self-suspended and this component is
    self-suspension related (Not necessary to be where exactly
    self-suspension happened).
    
    2) Allow self-suspension over-quota allocation privilege. Will ignore
    the quota limit of self-suspension components when granting stacks to
    them.
    
    3) Add a new interface to stack manager(detect_self_suspension). It
    returns the self-suspension counter of the component, where a positive
    value means there is self-suspension and 0 means not. Stack policy
    uses this interface to gather information about self-suspension. And
    policy ensures enough quota for those components.
    
    4) Fixed a bug: pre_wakeup should be called if a thread is waken up
    due to its dependency thread self-suspended.

    Fixed assert error in cos_sched_base which is caused by executing
    pre_block more than one time. Ensure each component at least owns one
    stack in stack manager.
    
    1) when we try to depend on other thread, we would execute pre_block
    which is the same as usual blocking. But we are not sure if we should
    be modifing wake_cnt here. Now the problem is if we depend on other
    threads more than once, the wake_cnt would be less than 0. We fixed it
    by only decreasing wake_cnt if it is greater than 0.
    
    2) Record a number of "empty components" in stack manager. And ensure
    the remaining stacks number is at least equal to the number of empty
    components. This can ensure each component has at least one stack
    quota. Also modified stack policy to ensure enough stacks for time
    event component(for temporal stack test).

    Stack misses take into account thread dependencies now.
    
    1) ensure that stacks hold the thread id of a thread using the stack
    
    2) in the stack manager, make sure that we use the sched_block with
    dependency support to provide priority inheritance of current thread
    causing a stack miss to the the thread holding the stack.
    
    3) take into account thread suspensions wrt the dependencies created.
    
    TODO: 1) if we attempt to make a dependency on a thread that is
    waiting for a stack in a component with self-suspended threads, then
    we should increase the self-suspension count of the component that
    actually has the threads with the self-suspensions...not the one we
    are stack missing in.  2) add support in the stack manager/policy to
    recognize self-suspension stack usage, and allocate stacks to
    components with SRT threads where the components have self-suspensions
    with priority to those that do not have self-suspensions.

    with sizeof(struct cos_stk).

    Added support for initialization file (initf) support.  If the init.o
    component is included in a run-script, it will load the init.tar file
    that can be retrieved via its interface.  The ift.o component
    (implementation/other/initf_test) tests this interface and gives an
    example of how to use it.  See the linitf_t.sh runscript for an
    example of how to use this.
    
    Things to note: 1) the init.tar file cannot be greater than ~3M.  2)
    if you include the init.o component, you better have an init.tar in
    your experimentation directory.  3) init.o cannot be cos loaded
    (i.e. it doesn't rely on sm.o, and uses simple stacks).

    cbufs now work across domains.  They are currently restricted in
    functionality: principal checks are not checked (i.e. no security),
    only the component that allocates a cbuf can deallocate it, only
    allocations PAGE_SIZE or less are allowed, and no page protections are
    currently used (i.e. they are read/write in every component.)
    
    Still needing testing are all basic functionalities, and the custom
    slabs (which are not tested at all).

    Initial testing on the cbuf infrastructure.  Mainly this tests the
    slab allocator in a single component, and not the cross-component
    functionality.  Fixed many bugs.

    Added to fprr with ifdefs to implement the server infrastructure.  The
    deferrable server simply includes the fprr implementation with
    DEFERRABLE defined.  Added code to ensure that THD_SUSPENDED works,
    including adding a linked list of all of all server threads so that
    budget refreshes can be implemented.
    
    Test cases include non-hierarchical and hierarchical servers.

    Add ability to run most of the system in a child scheduler.
    
    1) Separate mpd mgr into the actual manager, and the capablity graph
    (cgraph) storage.  The first is can now be booted and stkmanaged, the
    second cannot, but can be added to by the booter, and can be queried
    by other components.
    
    2) The boot/loader component no longer creates all threads for its
    components.  Components under a child scheduler will be created by
    that scheduler directly.  The scheduler must be initialized _after_
    the booter/loader runs.
    
    3) Added lws_hier.sh that boots the webserver in a child scheduler.
    
    4) Fixed a bug in the scheduler to ensure that child "timer" threads
    are not added into runqueues.
    
    NOTE:  I forgot to add the hw_ints.[ch] last time.  Added this time.

    Cleaned up hijack.c to remove dead/old code, and fixed page_fault interposition
    
    Removed much of the aed (asymmetric execution environments) code from hijack.c.
    
    Cleaned up the code in kern_entry.S to be easily extendable to
    arbitrary hardware entry points.
    
    Fixed (finally) the bug with page fault handling that precluded us
    interposing.  Module code being vmalloced and on-demand faulted in,
    could not define the page fault handler (doing so resulted in double
    faults).  Prevent this by defining a low-mem trampoline interposer
    that will go to the linux handler when the fault is in the
    kernel...otherwise enable our usual interposition.  Fricking pain in
    the ass.  2 weeks to determine what was causing the problem.  8 hours
    to code up the solution -- thus is the way of systems.

    Cleanup component configuration.  Now the loader tracks the
    initialization strings for each component, which schedulers they
    depend on, and give the scheduler the correct information regarding
    which components need threads to be created.  Additionally add support
    within the loader to identify schedulers, so that the configuration
    can tell which threads need to be started by which scheduler, which
    components belong to which schedulers.

    1) expanded stack tracing so that the current thread can trace
    it's steps, and fixed a condition for finding the stack pointer
    in a thread in a separate protection domain in the process of
    making an invocation.
    
    2) add support for idle in linux.  The idle system call will call
    out to Linux and put the composite thread on a wait queue.  The
    interactions between this and the interrupt/brand subsystem is
    complicated.  Idle is broken into three states: awake (in Linux
    runqueue), asleep (on the hijack waitq), and waking.  We know to
    remove the thread from the runqueue if it is asleep, but not if
    it is waking.
    
    3) fixed a bug in the interrupt/branding code where registers
    were being manipulated at the top of the thread's stack when they
    should have been.  This is the long-standing eip=0x10 bug.
    Concurrently fixed a bug resulting from nested interrupts and the
    idle state (which is what made idle so complicated).
    
    4) add more monitoring infrastructure.
    
    5) print out minimal component information on
    execution (including base address, and component id).
    
    6) Abstract out the implementation of most of the functionality
    for specific schedulers from the basic scheduling toolkit base.
    
    7) consolidate all the difficult switch thread bits into the
    sched_switch_thread function.  This includes moving the loop (on
    error, or switch-thread-self) and all dependency processing into
    a single location.  This is the best change I've made to the
    scheduler so far.  This touches a lot of code in fp_rr.c.

    2) Initial idle implementation including syscall.  Changes to inv and
    hijack.  Not currently completely functional.  Will hard crash easily
    if pushed.
    
    3) Fixed bug interfacing with the compiler in the initial mapping of
    the shared data page.
    
    4) Addeded an event notification bit into the scheduler notification
    page to signify that an event (upcall activation, or addition to the
    evtlist) has occured.  Avoid races -> want sched -> about to
    switch_thread -> event -> continue switching, missing event.  Not yet
    integrated with child/parent interaction.
    
    5) Consolidate all cos_switch_thread calls in fp_rr into a single
    function that deals with all error cases in a uniform manner and kills
    a lot of code.
    
    6) enable 32 rather than 16 syscalls.
    
    7) Fix bugs in the loader dealing with changing bfd versions.  Remove
    assumptions on presence of sections.
    
    8) add the sched_ops structure for abstracting away scheduler
    functionality, and implement a fp_ops, for the fixed priority runtime.

    Summary: add mpd policy, fix page faults, more mpd support
    
    - Page fault handling: 1) fix register handling to accommodate updated
      linux pt_regs structure and to clobber segment registers that were
      somehow wrong.  This is really a bug, and should be fixed correctly,
      but I don't know what's happening.  2) Add logic to allow deprecated
      protection domains to have components added to them from the current
      configuration when appropriate.
    
    - MPD: 1) add mpd policy including a heap implementation, 2) add a new
      flag to the mpd_cntl syscall -- UPDATE, which will switch from
      active to current mappings if we are in the entry component to a
      mpd.
    
    - Added second cgi program which included changing the cgi program to
      register a second handler if the first fails.
    
    - fd api now caches a certain number of event ids to cut down on IPC.

    Add the split method into the async_inv component; integrate with cgi
    
    Add the split method which is analogous to accept with sockets in that
    it is executed on an already open descriptor, and yields a new
    descriptor (thus split).  In this context (async_inv), the cgi script
    opens a single main descriptor that designates its service name, and
    it splits off requests, each of which is answered individually.  This
    makes it clear when a response is fully formulated as the descriptor
    is closed by the cgi script.

    Main point: change from using upcalls to synchronous event threads.
    
    1) Previously, we had upcall threads associated with brands.  Now we
    have synchronous threads that can "wait" on brands for a brand
    activation.  This allows invocations between components for
    upcall/event threads to progress exactly as normal invocations.  This
    has the benefit of falling into the current structure easily (for
    free!), but the detriment of possibly keeping a stale MPD around for
    longer.  Such is life.
    
    2) Add an event monitoring infrastructure into the kernel that records
    scheduling/upcall events into a ring buffer and the ring buffer is
    output when the module is removed.  This makes debugging problems
    associated with scheduling and events much easier.
    
    3) remove comp[123].c
    
    Thus concludes the life of this (successful) branch!

    the same protection domain.  Run the webserver tests with this and it
    locks up.
    
    3) add a stats component that uses interfaces exposed by lock (and
    soon evt) to print out statistical information.

    Add more counters in the kernel to monitor upcall behavior.
    Additionally, add support for statistical counters both in the kernel
    and in the cos_net component.  Add support in the kernel for measuring
    the latencies to go from brand-> upcall, pending brand-> upcall, and
    brand-> upcall done.
    
    Add a system call to print out the statistics and counters.
    
    Add an additional priority to the event component so that some events
    will never be triggered when others are available.  Currently only 2
    priorities are provided, but the code is fairly general.
    
    Remove the resume_return system call from inv.c.  Hasn't been used in
    a long time, and is probably wrong by now.
    
    Changes the scheduling semantics s.t. when an event is triggered from
    the kernel into the shared scheduling region, it clears a bit.  If
    this bit (next thread) isn't set on switch_thread, then return and
    make sure that the scheduler notices any events.
    
    Remove the "urgency" argument to switch_thread as it is ignored.
    
    Change cos_net to use the cos_map utility.
    
    Fix the idle processing of scheduler events.
    
    Change components that used a bootup thread then called sched_block
    indefinately.  Instead, they let the thead die and it is collected by
    the scheduler.

    1) fix the closing semantics so that closing a connection is done
       above the fd layer.  Connections still closed with abort (RST).
    
    2) fixed memory allocation in lwip by adding a "free" callback so that
    memory in pbuf->type == PBUF_ROM pbufs can be freed by our malloc/free
    implementation.  This included adding bookkeeping to the malloc/free
    implementations.
    
    3) Added stats in cos_net to track the amount of time spend in 4
    operations: interrupt -> buffer for application, add to app buffer ->
    application reads data, app reads data -> app writes on connection,
    app writes to lwip -> lwip sends to netdev.  There seems to be an
    issue here involving not printing this out frequently enough.

    without scheduler involvement.  This is undesirable when that upcall
    thread wakes up a middle priority thread and the preempted thread is
    the idle thread (low prio).  Now when the upcall completes, it will
    automatically switch to the idle thread.  Oops.  Added a flag for

    The focus of this patch is getting UDP recv/send working with a
    separate thread doing the receiving.  This includes adding an api to
    the cos_net component for reading and writing, binding and connecting.
    Numerous bug fixes have gone in here to solve bugs in fp_rr regarding
    how we were looping given cos_thread_switch errors.  Additionally, we
    added the error condition to that call (-2) that is triggered when we
    try and switch to an upcall that is not ready.  In the packet xmit
    path, we had to complicate the implementation given complications with
    the integration with Linux: When we xmit a packet, we must check if
    there are pending softirqs, and if there are, we must do_softirq, or
    we won't service the network driver transmit interrupts.  When we do
    this, it is possible (though not clear as to why) for us to service a
    softirq for a packet receive.  This should not be possible as as we
    have interrupts disabled while xmitting packets.  However, it does
    happen (perhaps because softirqs are deferred to softirqd), and at
    that point we must be able to switch to the upcall thread for dealing
    with that packet.  In the previous code-base, we were putting the
    transmitting thread into the preemption chain, but not marking it as
    preempted as we only really have edx, ecx, and eax.  However, when an
    upcall completed (in the pop function), it would assume that the
    previous thread in the preemption chain had been preempted, and thus
    would restore all of its registers.  As only ecx, edx, and eax are
    valid, this would cause quite random crashes.  I fixed this with a
    bandaid: don't add the transmitting thread to the preemption chain,
    thus causing unnecessary scheduler upcalls.  These seem to be on the
    order of 1000/sec which isn't enough to worry about.

    The main purpose of this patch is to provide buffered communication
    with the network for threads.  Threads can read and write from packet
    queues that are added to by the lwip layer.  Currently working
    (mostly) is UDP receive.  Still need to test UDP send, and get TCP
    working.  This was one hell of a patch to debug:
    
    1) changes to cos_alloc to add lock-free manipulations to the free
    lists (still need to make lock-free the heap ptr.
    
    2) changes to mem_man.c to fix an idiotic bug that made hardware
    aliaes for subsequent calls to map a page.  Ouch.  Support for aliases
    does not exist in the API as of now.
    
    3) fp_rr to clarify with some of the asserts that even threads that
    are not THD_READY, can make calls we would typically associate with
    ready threads.  This is due to upcalls waking asynchronously.  Also
    fixed up the sched_block call to take into account additional
    edge-cases.

    1) added cos_spd_name_map.h to translate component strings to their
    id.  This is used first in cos_loader to make sure that the components
    and their ids match up to the list in the .h file, and (now) in fp_rr
    to upcall into specific components by name as opposed to by
    hard-coding in the id.
    
    2) fixed up fp_rr such that the init thread is integrated into the
    scheduling infrastructure.  Now booting up is cleaner.
    
    3) added the ring_buff abstraction so as to simulate a
    network-provided packet ring buffer for a network device.  A ring
    buffer is attached to a (net) brand, so will contain only information
    relevant to that principal.  The ring buffers are constrained in that
    the buffers they point to much not overlap pages, and can have at most
    512 (pagesize/entrysize(=8)) packets pointed to in the ring.  Brand
    support in the networking code locates the appropriate user-level
    buffer on brand.  This eliminates the need for the ugly code to
    try_brand... called a few times in awkward places.  In the networking
    code (cosnet.c), the real skb_buff gets deallocated immediately as
    opposed to being queued in linux.  This is beneficial as it moves all
    that policy to components.

    invocation stack: upcall into the base scheduler.
    
    - Add system calls to read and reset the number of invocations between
    two components.
    
    - Add mechanism to pass the component graph to the mpd_mgr at load time.
    
    - Add dietlibc to be compiled into each component.  This allows the
    use of sprintf to setup a string, and pass it to the print component
    to print out.
    
    - Assorted flag manipulations in dietlibc to support correct string
    fns and our malloc.
    
    - Changes to fp_rr: support to pessimistic locks on a per-spd basis.
    Initial support for wait-free support for dependent tasks, wakeup and
    block calls with timeouts.  Support for a single timeout that will
    wakeup a specific (event) thread when it expires.
    
    - timed_event.c using the timeout capability from the scheduler,
    provide a component for managing generic timeouts.
    
    - lock.c to provide mutexes that can be timed using the timed_event
    support.  These work with synchronization.h such that no contention
    avoids calls to the lock component.  However, when there is
    contention, 3 calls to the lock component must be made in all
    (prelock, lock, and release) to avoid race conditions.
    
    - mailbox.c provides mailboxes using the locks above.  This code is
    NOT TESTED in this commit.
    
    - Cleaned up the assembly and stubs abstracting quite a bit into
    header files.  See s_stubmb.S for and example.
    
    - added mpd_mgr.c to currently just print out and zero # of
    invocations between components.
    
    - Painfully rewrote the component Makefile so that compiling with
    dietlibc worked and doesn't interfere with composite functionality.

    1) built up support for the deferrable server ds.c and interfaced it
    with the fprr.c.
    
    2) added the suspend and resume calls into fprr to ignore a task in
    the runqueues to be used by the deferrable server.
    
    3) decoupled the packet queue from the individual port, and instead
    associated it with an upcall thread.  Changed api into inv.c in a
    hideous way.

    1) fixed edge case in network handling where pending events weren't
    sent for packets arriving when the queue was full
    
    2) added a deferrable server which currently just receives upcalls and
    returns.
    
    3) added functionality to the fprr scheduler to run the deferrable
    server, and to exercise brands to test their performance.
    
    4) Modified the brand_upcall syscall to work again using
    brand_next_thread and co.  Possible pending bug: I don't save the
    eflags of the branding thread.  If we immediately execute the brand,
    and later (brand_execution_completion) return and restore the branding
    thread, it will load in the eflags register from the thread structure,
    which might not be valid.  Should probably just put a sanitized eflags
    value in when saving branding thread's contents.
    
    5) added the tests directory which contains data, plots, and plotting

    Fixed bugs related to getting the networking to work, and plugged in
    with brands.
    
    - Changed cosnet so that it maintains composite state across the
    lifetime of the module instead of the lifetime of the file holding
    process...this makes testing much less painful as the cnet_user script
    can be run in the forground and allowed to terminate.
    
    - fixed up the pending brands handling code including hooking in the
    callback to the networking module to remove a skb from the packet
    queue.
    
    - Included setting composite to the hightest priority as it seems to
    hide some bugs.
    
    - added a buglist to cronicle my pains.

    1) Add in support for making priority-informed decisions when a brand
    happens, and hook it up to the main code paths including those for
    reporting events to the schedulers.  Add in code to continue execution
    when there exist pending brands left.  There exists a bug when an
    upcall does not have urgency to execute, and then another brand is
    made.  For some-reason, the scheduler is not informed of the fact that
    the scheduler is still active when it returns.  This bug is detailed
    in fp_rr.c.  I have not plugged in the scheduling decisions when a
    thread terminates which are significantly more complicated.
    
    2) Make changes/additions to fp_rr to support these features.
    
    3) add in a networking component to interface with the networking
    support and the fp_rr.

    1) Add the notion of atomic operations allowing user-level sections of
    code in which upon a preemption, the kernel will see if the
    instruction pointer is in one of these regions, and if so, it will
    rollback the ip to the beginning of the region.  Allows for atomic
    operations without requiring atomic instructions and their overhead.
    Does _not_ work for multi-core/processor systems however.
    
    2) added the block and unblock on lock operations to the
    cos_thread_switch syscall allowing a scheduler to block on a
    (currently single) lock.  Created cos_sched_lock_{take|release}() in
    cos_scheduler.h to access this functionality.
    
    3) Fixed the behavior of interrupt threads whereby the preempted
    thread is scheduled before the interrupt thread finishes.  In this
    case, an upcall is made into the scheduler component notifying it of
    the termination, and allowing it to schedule another thread.

    interface.  This restriction is because I really don't want to write a

    alloc/free_page do not have prepended memory tracking info, so can be
    used to map pages (their intention).
    
    2) added the initial support for semaphore atomic instructions, mainly
    the assembly.

    This commit is too long, but I figured I'd push it with some things
    untested, than keep making it larger.  Wish not to repeat this again.
    
    - Clean the page fault handling path to actually work (fixing some
    race conditions)
    
    - add two page memory managers, the page_pool for page tables (used in
    mpd), and mmap, an array of pointers to pages to be used with the
    mmap_cntl syscall to grant/revoke memory pages
    
    - add the mmap_cntl syscall with grant and revoke, but without many
    practical checks (can we make a grant/revoke, are we allowed to
    execute mmap_cntl, etc...)
    
    - Add support both for the system info page and data pages.  Remove
    the get_thd_id syscall instead using the system info page information.
    
    - Enhance the loader to automatically create the capabilities from
    component to component.  This was a maintenance nightmare, and made me
    never want to add components.  For now, fixed, with a simple
    convention for naming the server and client stubs: For function
    fn_name, fn_name_inv is the stub both in the client and server.  In
    the client, there is a default stub when args are all passed in
    registers.
    
    - Change the ipc path to pass 4 args in registers instead of 3.
    
    - Fixed the reference counting for composite spds for upcall,
    branding, and creating threads.
    
    - Add some atomic ops and add support for them in the loader and the
    ioctl interface, but not yet in the interrupt paths.  Include cmpxchg.
    
    - Fill in, but don't complete the brand system call.  The code already
    exists to do this in the hijack file for timer interrupts, but not as
    a system call.  Adding that, but it will probably be put on hold as I
    don't think it's necessary for the tests.
    
    - Add initial support for cos_scheduler.{c|h}: lib code for
    schedulers.  Need the atomic instructions to really make this work.

       contemplated;).  This includes altering the mpd_cntl syscall and
       adding support for merge and split.  split_merge is a noop currently.
    
    2) change thd_get_thd_spd and thd_get_current_spd to return an spd
       rather than an spd_poly.  Change system calls so that the first
       argument passed in is the current spd, so that it can be identified
       for use with (1).  The long term plan (detailed in a comment in
       cos_component.h) is to make system calls component invocations, which
       also gives us an spd id, but also allows us to switch components to
       kernel-level.
